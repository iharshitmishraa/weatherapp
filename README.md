🔍 Search Functionality: Find weather updates by entering city names.
📍 Location-Based Weather: Option to get weather details using your current location.
🌄 Responsive Design: Optimized for desktop, tablet, and mobile views.
🌈 Dynamic Backgrounds: Backgrounds change based on the weather conditions.
Technology Stack
Frontend Framework: React (or your chosen framework/library)
Styling: Tailwind CSS, CSS Modules, or any preferred styling framework
API Integration: OpenAPI (e.g., OpenWeatherMap API)
State Management: React Context API/Redux (if applicable)
Geolocation: Browser Geolocation API
